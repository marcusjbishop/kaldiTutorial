By far, the most onerous step of the process
is in the preparation of the data.
The dataset consists of a number of hours of speech,
ideally spoken by of a variety of individuals of a variety of genders.
The data is divided into {\em utterances},
each roughly corresponding with a sentence of speech.
The utterances are divided into two sets, a training set
containing $95\%$ of the utterances,
and a test set containing $5\%$.
Everything calculated for these two sets
will be stored in the directories \verb!data/train! and \verb!data/test!
respectively. For brevity,
we will describe the \verb!data/train! directory only,
but the contents of \verb!data/test! are exactly the same.
Note that the \verb!iban! recipe uses \verb!data/dev!
rather than \verb!data/test!. Some recipes contain {\em both}
a \verb!data/dev! directory and a \verb!test! directory.

Every utterance is first assigned an {\em utterance ID} using
whatever scheme is convenient. For example,
\verb!ibf_001_001! is the first utterance ID
in \verb!iban!. The first \verb!001! refers to the speaker
and the second to the utterance delivered by this individual.
Note the zero padding of both integers; this ensures that the \verb!unix!
\verb!sort! command will sort utterance IDs lexicographically
in the speaker and utterance. None of the conventions described above
are required, but are considered good practice.

Next, the transcription of each utterance is written, one utterance
per line, to the file \verb!data/train/text!, with the utterance ID
first, followed by a space, followed by the transcription. For example,
the first two lines of \verb!data/train/text! are shown below.
\begin{verbatim}
ibf_001_001  pukul sepuluh malam  
ibf_001_002  selamat malam diatu kami naburka berita ari radio malaysia sarawak waifm
\end{verbatim}

In a similarly way, the file \verb!data/train/wav.scp! specifies
the exact locations of the corresponding audio files. The first
two lines of this file are shown below.
\begin{verbatim}
ibf_001_001 /export/kaldi/egs/iban/s5/corpus/data/wav/ibf_001/ibf_001_001.wav
ibf_001_002 /export/kaldi/egs/iban/s5/corpus/data/wav/ibf_001/ibf_001_002.wav
\end{verbatim}

Also following the same pattern is the file \verb!data/train/utt2spk!,
which specifies the speakers of each utterance.
\begin{verbatim}
ibf_001_001 ibf_001
ibf_001_002 ibf_001
\end{verbatim}
Note that in the \verb!iban! example the speaker IDs can be extracted
from any utterance ID because of the labeling schemes chosen.
However, since no such scheme is required, the file
\verb!data/train/utt2spk! is necessary.

In inverse of the mapping given by \verb!data/train/utt2spk!
is given in the file \verb!data/train/spk2utt!, the beginnings of the first
two lines of which are shown below. This file can be preprepared
using the utility \verb!utils/spk2utt_to_utt2spk.pl!
\begin{verbatim}
ibf_001 ibf_001_001 ibf_001_002 ibf_001_003 ibf_001_004 ibf_001_005 ...
ibf_011 ibf_011_001 ibf_011_002 ibf_011_003 ibf_011_004 ibf_011_005 ...
\end{verbatim}
