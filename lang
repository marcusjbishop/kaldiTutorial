In the \verb!iban! example, the files described in this section
are created by the script \verb!utils/prepare_lang.sh!.
Note that in contrast with the scripts mentioned in
the previous two sections, \verb!utils/prepare_lang.sh!
is a utility common to all recipes.
The script takes the dictionary prepared in \autoref{dict}
and produces a directory, say, \verb!data/lang! containing the files
described below.

\verb!utils/prepare_lang.sh! takes the dictionary prepared
in \autoref{dict} and creates the data to be used in traning
the language model.

By default each non-silence phone will be modeled by an HMM
with three hidden states and transistions as shown below.
\digraph[scale=0.5]{nonsilenceHmm}{
rankdir=LR;
{ node [shape="doublecircle"] 3;}
{ node [shape="circle"] 1 2}
1->1;
1->2;
2->2;
2->3;
}
