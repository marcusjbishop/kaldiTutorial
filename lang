In the \verb!iban! example, the files described in this section
are created by the script \verb!utils/prepare_lang.sh!.
Note that in contrast with the scripts mentioned in
the previous two sections, \verb!utils/prepare_lang.sh!
is a utility common to all recipes.
The script takes the dictionary prepared in \autoref{dict}
and produces a directory, say, \verb!data/lang! containing the files
described below.
