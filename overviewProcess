The main ingredient in an ASR system
is a large corpus of transcribed recordings of people speaking.
After this data as been assembled and prepared,
the main steps are the constructions
of a {\em language model}, a {\em pronunciation lexicon}, and an
{\em acoustic model}.
In \textsf{Kaldi} all these steps are implemented using
{\em finite state transducers}.
With these models in place, new audio samples
can be transcribed with the help of a {\em decoding graph}.
All of these steps are described in more detail below.
