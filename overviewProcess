The main ingredient in an ASR system
is a large corpus of transcribed recordings of people speaking.
After this data as been assembled and prepared,
which we describe in \autoref{data},
the main steps are the constructions
of a {\em language model}, a {\em pronunciation lexicon}, and an
{\em acoustic model}.
These models are discussed in \autoref{model}.
In \textsf{Kaldi} all these models are implemented using
{\em finite state transducers}, which we describe
in \autoref{fst}.
With these models in place, new audio samples
can be transcribed with the help of a {\em decoding graph},
which we describe in \autoref{decode}.
