The purpose of this document is twofold.
First we intend to summarize the main steps
of automatic speech recognition (ASR)
in a mathematically rigorous way for the benefit
of readers who are new to speech,
but who have mathematical backgrounds.
By documenting the entire process from end to end,
we hope that the document will make ASR more accessible to beginners
working in technical fields.
Our second purpose is to concurrently describe
how each step of the process is implemented in the ASR system
\textsf{Kaldi} \cite{kaldi}.
Our hope is that our description of the process will be helpful,
even if \textsf{Kaldi} changes or becomes obsolete.
