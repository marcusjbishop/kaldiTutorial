The purpose of this document is twofold.
First we intend to summarize the main steps
of automatic speech recognition (ASR)
in a mathematically rigorous way for the benefit
of readers new to speech, but with mathematical backgrounds.
Second, we will concurrently describe
how these steps are implemented in the ASR system
\textsf{Kaldi} \cite{kaldi}.
Our hope is that our description of the process will be helpful,
even if \textsf{Kaldi} changes or becomes obsolete.
Also, by documenting the entire process from end to end,
we hope that this document will make \textsf{Kaldi} more accessible
to beginners.
