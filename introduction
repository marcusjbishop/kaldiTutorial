The purpose of this document is twofold.
First we summarize the main steps of automatic speech recognition (ASR)
in a mathematically rigorous way. Second, we concurrently describe
how these steps are implemented in the ASR system
\textsf{Kaldi} \cite{kaldi}.
Our hope is that our description of the process will be helpful,
even if \textsf{Kaldi} changes or becomes obsolete.

\textsf{Kaldi} is an ASR toolkit consisting of a variety
of shell scripts and compiled \texttt{C++} programs.
\textsf{Kaldi} is published on
\href{https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi}{\texttt{github}}
under the
\href{https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0}{Apache 2.0 licence}
and is maintained by researchers at
\href{https://www.jhu.edu}{Johns Hopkins University}.
It has been widely adopted in both academics and industry.

\textsf{Kaldi} has also been recently shown to be an effective
optical character recognition (OCR) engine. While this might sound
surprising, it is quite natural in light of the similarity
of the ASR and OCR tasks, as we discuss below.
