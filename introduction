The purpose of this document is twofold.
First we summarize the main steps of automatic speech recognition (ASR)
in a mathematically rigorous way. Second, we concurrently describe
how these steps are implemented in the ASR system
\textsf{Kaldi} \cite{kaldi}.
Our hope is that our description of the process will be helpful,
even if \textsf{Kaldi} changes or becomes obsolete.
