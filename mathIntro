Around 1980 a group at IBM started thinking about speech
as a communication system, using the {\em source-channel model},
which we now summarize in this context.
The {\em speaker} formulates a sequence of words $\mathbold{W}$ in his or her mind,
and articulates $\mathbold{W}$ using his or her vocal apparatus.
The resulting sound passes through space, a {\em noisy channel},
to the {\em interlocutor}, which might be another person, or an ASR system
such as \textsf{Kaldi}.
The interlocutor is equipped with an {\em acoustic processor} which turns
the signal into a sequence of vectors $\mathbold{A}$ capturing
{\em acoustic features} of the signal at multiple timesteps.
The acoustic processor could be the auditory system of a human,
or it could be a computer program, whose design is often motivated
by the human auditory system.
Finally, a {\em linguistic decoder} converts $\mathbold{A}$ into
a hypothesis $\widehat\mathbold{W}$ by the formula
\begin{equation}\label{FirstArgmax}
\widehat\mathbold{W}=\argmax_{\mathbold{W}}
P\left(\mathbold{W}\;\middle\vert\;\mathbold{A}\right).
\end{equation}
It is convenient to rewrite \autoref{FirstArgmax} using Bayes rule as
\[\widehat\mathbold{W}=\argmax_{\mathbold{W}}
\frac{ P\left(\mathbold{A}\;\middle\vert\;\mathbold{W}\right) P\left(\mathbold{W}\right)}
{P\left(\mathbold{A}\right)} \]
which further simplifies to
\[\widehat\mathbold{W}=\argmax_{\mathbold{W}}
P\left(\mathbold{A}\;\middle\vert\;\mathbold{W}\right)
P\left(\mathbold{W}\right)\]
since $\mathbold{A}$ is taken to be fixed throughout the process
of decoding $\mathbold{A}$.

Therefore one needs to assemble the following models
in order to implement ASR as described above.
\begin{enumerate}
\item the {\em language model} $P\left(\mathbold{W}\right)$
\item the {\em acoustic model} $P\left(\mathbold{A}\;\middle\vert\;\mathbold{W}\right)$
\item\label{argmax} a way to calculate the $\argmax$ in \autoref{FirstArgmax}
\end{enumerate}
We remark that \autoref{argmax} is nontrivial in light
of the sheer number of possible hypotheses, which renders it
impossible to calculate the $\argmax$ by brute force.
We consider each of these subproblems in the following sections.
