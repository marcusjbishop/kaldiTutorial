In contrast with much of the software running on large
compute infrastructures,
in which a system administrator installs the software for everyone to
use, \textsf{Kaldi} users generally download and compile
their own copies of the software.
One fetches the repository from
\href{https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi}{\texttt{github}},
unpacks it, and compiles it according
the instructions in the \verb!INSTALL!
file at the top level of the distribution.

Also at the top level are the following directories.
The \verb!src! directory contains the source code for the main
binary programs, which one finds in \verb!src/bin! after compilation.
Users call some of these commands directly, but more commonly,
these commands are invoked by various shell
scripts, since those commands often require unwieldy command-line arguments
and must chained together.

The \verb!tools! and \verb!extras!
directories contains a handful of language modeling and
finite state transducer utilities.

Finally, the \verb!egs! directory contains a few dozen example
ASR systems, each presented in its own subdirectory as a {\em recipe}.
The contents of a recipe are described below, but we mention
here that the scripts mentioned above are essentially shared
by all recipes and live in subdirectories of each recipe
called \verb!steps! and \verb!utils!, rather than a common
location, such as \verb!src/bin! as one might expect.
