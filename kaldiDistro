Unlike a lot of software one expects to use on large compute infrastructures,
such as \textsf{Matlab},
in which a system administrator installs the software for all users to
use, each user wishing to use \textsf{Kaldi} downloads and compiles
his or her own copy of the software.
One fetches the repository from \verb!github.com!, unpacks it,
and compiles it according the the instructions in the \verb!INSTALL!
file at the top level of the distribution.

Also at the top level are the following directories.
The \verb!src! directory contains the source for the main
binary programs, which one finds in \verb!src/bin! after compilation.
Users call some of these commands directly, but many of them are called by
scripts, as described below.

The \verb!tools! directory contains a handful of language modeling and
finite state transducer tools.

Finally, the \verb!egs! directory contains a few dozen example
ASR systems, each presented in its own subdirectory as a {\em recipe}.
The contents of a recipe are described below, but we mention
here that the scripts mentioned above are essentially shared
by all the example recipes and live in subdirectories each recipe
called \verb!steps! and \verb!utils!.
