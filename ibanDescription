As a running example, we will reference
the freely available \verb!iban! dataset
\cite{Juan14,Juan2015}.
The corpus consists of a number of hours of
news speech in the Iban language,
provided by a local radio station in Sarawak, Malaysia.

We encourage the reader to try running the recipe in \verb!egs/iban/s5!,
while will automatically fetch the dataset from
\href{http://www.openslr.org}{\texttt{openslr.org}}.
A nice way to run the recipe is to run the following command
in \verb!egs/iban/s5!.
\begin{verbatim}
./run.sh 2>&1 | tee log
\end{verbatim}
This will merge the standard output and standard error and save
them both to the file \verb!log! for later inspection, while also printing
the same output the your screen.
You also might find it convenient to run \verb!screen!
before the command above. Then if your session becomes interrupted,
you can return later to the same machine and resume with
\verb!screen -r!.

The command above will take two or three hours to complete.
If it completes correctly, you can also run the following
command to train the neural-network part of the process.
\begin{verbatim}
./local/chain/run_tdnn.sh 2>&1 | tee run-tdnn.log
\end{verbatim}
