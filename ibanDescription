As a running example, we will reference the \verb!iban! recipe,
which implements the freely available \verb!iban! dataset
\cite{Juan14,Juan2015}.
The corpus consists of a number of hours of
news speech in the Iban language,
provided by a local radio station in Sarawak, Malaysia.

We encourage the reader to try running the recipe, which
will automatically fetch the dataset from
\href{http://www.openslr.org}{\texttt{openslr.org}}.
A nice way to run the recipe is to run the following command
in the \verb!egs/iban/s5! directory.
\begin{verbatim}
./run.sh 2>&1 | tee log
\end{verbatim}
This will merge the standard output and standard error and save
them both to the file \verb!log! for later inspection, while also printing
the same output the your screen.
You also might find it convenient to run \verb!screen!
before executing the command above. In that situation,
in case your session becomes interrupted,
either intentionally or otherwise,
you can return later to the same machine and resume the program with
the command \verb!screen -r!.

The command above will take two or three hours to complete.
If it completes correctly, you can also run the following
command to train the neural-network part of the process.
\begin{verbatim}
./local/chain/run_tdnn.sh 2>&1 | tee run-tdnn.log
\end{verbatim}
